# Event Impact Modeling Methodology

## 1. Data Sources
- Historical data from Ethiopia (Global Findex 2011-2024)
- Comparable country evidence (Kenya, Tanzania, India, Ghana)
- Expert assessment of event significance

## 2. Impact Estimation Approach
### 2.1 Direct Historical Evidence (Where available)
- Telebirr: Impact estimated from 2021-2024 account ownership growth
- M-Pesa: Impact estimated from 2021-2024 mobile money growth
- Attribution percentages based on market analysis

### 2.2 Comparable Country Evidence (Where Ethiopian data limited)
- NFIS II: Based on impact of Kenya's MFS strategy
- Interoperability: Based on India's UPI experience
- 4G Expansion: Based on mobile money growth in Tanzania

## 3. Model Parameters
### 3.1 Impact Magnitude
- Expressed as annual percentage point change
- Direction: positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing)
- Confidence levels: High/Medium/Low based on evidence quality

### 3.2 Time Dynamics
- Lag months: Delay before impact begins
- Assumed linear impact over time
- No decay function applied (simplified model)

## 4. Model Validation
- Compared modeled impacts against historical trends
- Adjusted magnitudes to better fit Ethiopian data
- Acknowledged limitations due to sparse data

## 5. Key Assumptions
1. Impacts are additive (no interaction effects)
2. Linear impact over time
3. No saturation effects considered
4. Comparable country impacts scale proportionally
5. Policy impacts take longer than product launches

## 6. Future Improvements Needed
1. More granular time-series data
2. Urban-rural impact differentiation
3. Gender-disaggregated impact modeling
4. Interaction effects between events
5. Non-linear impact functions
